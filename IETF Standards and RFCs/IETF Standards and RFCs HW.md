## 1. Codec Encoding for LossLess Archiving and Realtime transmission (cellar)

### About:

The preservation of audiovisual materials faces challenges from technological obsolescence, analog media deterioration, and the use of proprietary formats that lack formal open standards. While obsolescence and material degradation are widely addressed, the standardization of open, transparent, self-descriptive, lossless formats remains an important mission to be undertaken by the open source community.

FFV1 is a lossless video codec and Matroska is an extensible media container based on EBML (Extensible Binary Meta Language), a binary XML format. There are open source implementations of both formats, and an increasing interest in and support for use of FFV1 and Matroska. However, there are concerns about the sustainability and credibility of existing specifications for the long-term use of these formats. These existing specifications require broader review and formalization in order to encourage widespread adoption.

There is also a need for a lossless audio format to complement the lossless video codec and container format. FLAC is a lossless audio codec that has seen widespread adoption in a number of different applications including archival applications. While there are open source implementations of the codec, no formal standards for either the codec itself or its use in container formats currently exist. Review and formalization of the FLAC codec standard and its use in Matroska container formats is needed for wider adoption.
